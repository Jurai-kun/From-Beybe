He became a friend, 
Then in the end my lover.
Circumtances come and pass,
Left without hearing me out.

I'm still here. 
Loving you.
Hoping that one day,
You'll come back in my arms.
Again.

Months passed,
We met each other gazes, again.
Tried to catch up,
To what we've missed.

I missed you so much,
So thankful that the day has come.
Day that you'll be back in my arms,
Loving me, again.

A free-versed poem.
For the owner of this account.
Happy one month of love,
Ego semper amabo te. 

It is 사랑해 in Korean,
I love you, in English.
Hahahahaha.
